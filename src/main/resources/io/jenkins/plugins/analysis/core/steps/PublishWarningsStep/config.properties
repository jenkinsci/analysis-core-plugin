title.onlyUseStableBuildsAsReference=Only use stable builds as reference
description.onlyUseStableBuildsAsReference=Use the last stable build as the reference to compute the number of new \
                   warnings against. This allows to ignore interim unstable builds for which the number of warnings \
                   decreased. Note that the last stable build is evaluated only by inspecting the unit test failures. \
                   The static analysis results are not considered.
title.usePreviousBuildAsReference=Use previous build as reference
description.usePreviousBuildAsReference=If set the number of new warnings will always be computed based on the \
                   previous build, even if that build is unstable (due to a violated warning threshold). \
                   Otherwise the last build that did not violate any \
                   given threshold will be used as reference. It is recommended to uncheck this option if \
                   the plug-in should ensure that all new warnings will be finally fixed in subsequent builds.
